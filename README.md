# Mumble-URL-Fix-Window
A quick repo to explain how to get Mumble links working in Windows 10/11

Download the registry file mumble.reg and double click on it to install the registry entry
This will ask you if you wish to make the changes, feel free to not accept if you are worried but it is required for the fix.

After you have made the registry change you can now click on mumble:// links - The first time you do this you will most likely have your web browser ask if you want to run mumble, do what you want but if you don't say yes, it won't work.

If you are a Goon then reach out to Sillat/Midnight Space Money if you need some extra clarification.

Right click the link above and save it somewhere. If your browser wants to save as .txt (or does save as .txt) then remove the .txt (the file needs to end in .reg to enable double clicking to install it.)
